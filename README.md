1. Overall Project Objectives
Yelp is an application to provide the platform for customers to write reviews and provide a star-rating. A research indicates that a one-star increase led to 59% increase in revenue of independent restaurants. Therefore, we see great potential of Yelp dataset as a valuable insights repository.

The main purpose of our project is to conduct thorough analysis on 7 different cuisine types of restaurants which are Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese,Thai, French and Italian, figure out what makes a good restaurant and what concerns customers, and then make recommendations of the future improvement and profit growth. Specifically, we will mainly analyze customers' reviews and figure out reasons why customers love or dislike the restaurant. For example, there may be great reviews primarily due to the friendly service, or negative reviews about high price. Meanwhile, we will also compare among those 7 different cuisine types and figure out differences from reviews and gain valuable insights to make customized recommendations to different types of restaurants.
