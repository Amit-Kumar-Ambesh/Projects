# User Engagement Analysis For RESTAURANT SUCCESS
# About Yelp
Yelp is a web and mobile platform that functions as a crowd-sourced local
business review site. Users can submit reviews, photos, and tips about
businesses, while also browsing information and ratings left by others.


## Data Overview
This dataset is a subset of Yelp and has information about businesses
across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.
The original data is shared by Yelp as JSON files.
The five JSON files are business, review, user, tip and checkin.
The JSON files are stored in the database for easy retrieval of data.
